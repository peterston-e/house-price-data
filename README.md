# Pandas project to transform and manipulate house price data.
Due to issues with file sizes I have had issues pushing and pulling the CSV file. 

To get around this I have had to upload it to GitHub manually. as a consequence, any attempts to clone and pull this 
file wil likely fail. But it is available to download manually. 
Alternatively all the data is available on the Government's website and as the schema doesn't change any file will work.


Data can be downloaded from Gov website:
