# Pandas project to transform and manipulate house price data.
Due to issues with file sizes, I have had problems pushing and pulling the CSV file. 

To get around this, I have had to upload it to GitHub manually. Consequently, any attempts to clone and pull this 
file will likely fail. But it is available to download manually. 
Alternatively, all the data is available on the Government's website, and as the schema doesn't change, any file will work.


Data can be downloaded from the Gov website:
